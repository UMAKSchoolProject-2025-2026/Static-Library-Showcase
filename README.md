This project is my OOP activity where I made my own library and used it in a calculator app.

I started by creating a Library (.NET) project in Visual Studio and wrote the logic for the required methods.

After that, I made a new calculator project to showcase the library.

I added the library by adding an existing project and then added it as a project reference so the calculator can use the methods I made.

The calculator has basic validation and lets you continue after a calculation.

This activity mainly shows how to use a custom library in another project.
